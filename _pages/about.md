I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Machine Learning in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. My research currently focuses on learning causality from physics simulations. Prior to this, I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. The focus of my Ph.D. thesis was on using Graph Networks to learn particle dynamics and control.
