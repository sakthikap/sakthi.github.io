This course provides an introduction to the fundamental methods and algorithms at the core of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. It also covers theoretical foundations as well as essential algorithms and practical techniques for supervised and unsupervised learning.

A wide range of engineering applications will be explored so that students learn the differences between AIML algorithms as they pertain to engineered-systems and why it is challenging for a single AIML algorithm to be successfully applied across all types of engineering problems. The course will seek to connect data to algorithms, and ultimately, to the design and optimization of engineered-systems and physical phenomena.
